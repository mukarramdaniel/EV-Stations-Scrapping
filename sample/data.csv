We had the ok from her doctor who said she was in good health for the trip. We are staying at motels and friends along the way.
This morning, when I got here, the EV charger wasn't working. I went over to the Ravensthorpe council to ask if it was possible to access to 3 phase power. They were not able to provide 3 phase power. One of the staff members at the Ravensthorpe council made some phone calls and sent me to a local mechanic who had a 3 phase power socket.  When I got there, I realised I had bought the wrong three phase cord :-/
He also made a few phone calls.  I was contacted by the owner of the EV charger, who then went over and above to ensure I was able to get my car charged today inorder to get to Esperance. Everyone I encountered today helped us. I am extremely grateful for the extraordinary care and support we received. Thank you to everyone who helped make it possible for me to get my mother safely to our next destination.

(Rating: 1), Lovely staff. $35 for the recharge and as others have had once initialising complete the system needed me to unlock the port and reinsert the cable to start charging.  (Rating: 1), Started charging at 0615am. Like the similar Delta charger at Balladonia, after unlocking it, waiting for the initialisation process then plugging in when the charger screen says to, it usually fails to 'lock connector' successfully and requests 'remove connector'. Don't worry, it soon requests you to 'connect connector' again, after which it starts charging and all is good. This has happened each time I've used these Delta chargers - five times now.
 (Rating: 1), The staff kindly started up the Delta DC charger. Getting 20kW and very happy. Thanks Madura  Pass! (Rating: 1), Worked after second insertion after booting up. Guys were friendly and helpful. They disable the 3 phase socket that feeds the 22kW charger between use due to some entitled people helping themselves to the 3 phase socket. Here for 20mins, quick boost before Border Village (Rating: 1), Took two goes to get it going but worked flawless after that (Rating: 1), Quick top-up before heading to Caiguna.
Atto Gal will be plugging in for a couple of hours after me.. please be aware :) (Rating: 1), Working fine.
Same type of unit as at Balladonia, but doesn't seem to have the connection issues.
If the operator plugs your car in before the charger finishes booting don't worry. It gives an error and all you need to do is unplug from the car and re-plug.
You DO NOT have to reboot the machine!! (Rating: 1), Forgot to add, it took 3 times for my car to read the charger. Don't panic! Just take it out and start again. Working beautifully now. (Rating: 0)","https://www.plugshare.com/location/131873","Madura Pass Oasis Motel"

PLEASE NOTE: You might notice that POWER to the Tesla charger comes from inside the box‚Ä¶only when the black cable/orange 5pin connector is plugged into something! to get the hpwc Tesla charger to be powered, you must plug it into the 5 pin 3 phase 32 amp socket, and turn this socket from OFF to ON. You will then get green light on the Tesla charger once it is powered. PS‚Ä¶it might already be plugged in when you arrive, might just need to turn from OFF to ON.

If you keep getting charging errors, double check that the cable is straight when you plug it in.

One suggestion, though. It may be better to put the stations in the parking spots furthest from the supermarket and toilets. I expect that in the proposed location, the stations will be blocked by non-electric vehicles most of the time. Putting the stations at the furthest point will avoid this and I don't think EV drivers will mind driving 30 meters further. Also as this is a location without any alternate charging facilities nearby, it would be good to have more than one station. Stations break down and if it is the only station in the area then many EV drivers may not risk getting stranded due to the only charger being off-line. -- checkin created before location officially marked open (Rating: 0), Location changed to the aldi carpark next to the public toilets.

There is however a standard 10amp outdoor double powerpoint just behind on another pole. Successfully charged at ~15km/h with our BYO Tesla Mobile Connector. Worked for a small top up while we sampled some nice wines.  (Rating: 1), So we established that the charger in the visitor carpark is still out of order but as we were leaving we also discovered that if you ask the staff nicely they will show you how to hook up to the second tesla hpwc which is tucked away in the staff carpark. A little difficult to access but we did plug in to check it was possible and working. 15km/hr charging which would have covered the side trip off the main rd and given us a little more leeway on the Robe to Tailem Bend leg. The wine and beer tasting was pleasant as was the outdoor seating looking out over the vineyards. There is also a lovely organic garden with produce you can sample.  (Rating: 1), Unable to charge.

Type 1 connector which needs a Type 2 connector for Tesla.  Needs to obtain a charge point card at the post office @ Penneshaw on disembarking from the ferry. It's a free service and no charges for charging the car.  You're required to return the card on leaving KI.
Charging at 30A @ 48km/hr.  Suits us well to disconnect after a couple of hours, under 5 minutes walk from the hotel.

Not great! (Rating: -1), 3 phase 24A (Rating: 1), Chargers in front of room six (on the pole) and to the first parking space to the right of the reception. Hotel staff are completely uneducated and clueless about the chargers so probably fine to charge without them knowing. Otherwise, if you are an honest person then you can fork out the $16/night rack rate if you like (hotel guests only). Non hotel guests charge for $30 per day which is also ridiculous - in this case I suggest you charge at the ESH rapid charger instead. (Rating: 1), Judy recently had these two Tesla destination charges installed. One is undercover directly outside motel room 6. Good for a model S (we parked nose in and cable reached charge port) but an X might need to park in adjacent spot next door (which does not have carport style roof over it) to charge.

(Rating: 1),  (Rating: 1),  (Rating: 1),  (Rating: 1), Ok so consider this a general public service announcement for everyone. I don‚Äôt want to get into a back and forth with you Terry I understand your frustration. First up though remember that this charging station was installed by the Uni for Uni employees and so during working hours it will always be completely filled up by employees so if you are not an employee don‚Äôt bother to even try to find a spare station. I‚Äôm not saying people who don‚Äôt work there are not welcome. I‚Äôm just stating that as a reality. I work at the Uni in the building right next to the charging station and have been using the charger for just over 2 years now. It is getting busier and busier every month. On the whole though it works well. Remember that because we are all busy working it is sometimes impossible to move your car the very moment you get the notification that it has finished charging. But I have found most people move it at the next available break. Morning tea, lunch and afternoon tea breaks are the best times to go out and check for a spare spot. Employees just park near the chargers and go out at those times to check for a newly opened spot and move their car in because you can always count on someone else going out to move their car away at one of those times if it has finished charging. I know in a perfect world everyone would use an app like this and back even a couple of years ago most of us did but as EV‚Äôs continue to increase in popularity it‚Äôs not just tech savvy enthusiasts who have them and expecting regular people, who are just charging their car at work, to use an app to do so is becoming increasingly unlikely. The Uni did say last year that they are going to add some more charging stations this year to help with the growing number of employees with EV‚Äôs so hopefully soon it will ease up a bit. But to reinforce my earlier point. If you are not an employee of the Uni and so cannot therefore leave your car nearby and come out and check for spare spaces during the work day, then do not bother visiting hoping that you will find a spot because it is always full all the time during the work day. After hours and on weekends absolutely go for it because it is very often completely empty.  (Rating: 0), Hi Andrew. I looked at the charge indicator lights on all 4 Tesla's and it appeared to me none were charging, perhaps I made a mistake with yours. If the 4 Tesla's there were using plug share, perhaps you could have also had a chance to use the faster charger, and if I had known they were in use I would not have wasted my time and charge going there. (Rating: 0), I was one of those cars and you are very wrong. Because I didn‚Äôt get there early enough to get one of the Tesla chargers I had to use the slow ones and I was plugged in all day and still only got to 67%. You even left a note on my windshield. So perhaps don‚Äôt go accusing people of things they are not doing hey. Also when you work at the Uni and charge every few days and always go out and move your car as soon as you get the notification that it has finished then using an additional app is just superfluous.

I let them know when I'd sign out and that it was a standard AC. I made sure i didnt have a schedule on it as well. Car was ready for me in the morning, and the cable had definitely been taken out and used, but it hadn't been charged at all. Guessing it was a fault on my end with scheduling settings.

Second issue: the ‚Äústart cut out timer‚Äù for the unit is very short, meaning that you have a very short period of time to plug the cable in after you select ‚Äúunlock‚Äù in the app.
Third issue: once you‚Äôve got it charging, the ‚Äústop‚Äù button on the charger doesn‚Äôt work. You can press it; it beeps; but it doesn‚Äôt do anything, meaning your car will remain tethered to the charger.it can only be stopped using the app.
I called Chargefox, and the person was friendly but didn‚Äôt appear to think that my reporting any of this would result in any change. They just said they‚Äôd log it as feedback.
