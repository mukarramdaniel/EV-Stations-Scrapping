Data organized neatly into an excel spreadsheet with the following columns:
Station owner
Street
City
State
Suburb
Postcode
Charger plug type
How many chargers at the station
Charge speed in kWh
Installation date
Network name
Plugshare score
Latest comments with Plugshare score.

Ideally, I'd like you to build this into a Power BI Dashboard.‚Äù



The client will be able to run the code himself around every two weeks, to update the dashboard automatically.

We need to scrape all the EV Plug Stations in Australia.
